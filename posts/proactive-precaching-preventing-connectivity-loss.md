# Proactive Precaching: Preventing Connectivity Loss

## Introduction
In modern web development, it's common for web applications to consume large amounts of data from the server. As a result, network connectivity can become a critical bottleneck, and network requests can result in slow loading times and poor user experiences.

One way to mitigate this issue is through client-side caching. Caching involves storing data on the client-side, allowing subsequent requests to retrieve the data from the cache instead of making additional server requests. This technique can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of web applications, particularly when dealing with data that changes infrequently.

One use case for client-side caching is when we need to maintain objects in memory to avoid repeatedly fetching them from the server. By storing frequently used data on the client-side, we can reduce the number of requests sent to the server and speed up the application's response time. Even in scenarios where connectivity is temporarily lost, data stored in the cache can be retrieved, allowing the application to continue functioning seamlessly.

## The problem

Suppose an education company offers online assessments to students and needs to maintain uninterrupted user experience even when the connection is unstable. During the assessments, multimedia assets like audio, video, and images are provided with the questions. However, the students cannot access the assets if they lose their internet connection temporarily. This results in poor performance and a bad experience overall.

To address this problem, the company's technical team developed a client-side caching solution. This solution caches the multimedia assets on the client-side so that even if the students lose connectivity, they can still access the assets. The solution is designed to be lightweight, simple to implement, and provide a seamless user experience.
